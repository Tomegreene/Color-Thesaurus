This is intended to be an extension of the color thesaurus from: http://ingridsnotes.wordpress.com/2014/02/04/the-color-thesaurus/ 

I am aiming to collapse things down to a single viewable grid with a drop down list for all the different categories of colors. Also it will include the hex values along with English names for the colors to help developers, and designers communicate clearly.

It is using Angular javascript framework which might be a bit overkill.
